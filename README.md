# Personal OpenCode Agents

This repository stores the system prompts for my personal, global OpenCode agents.

## Contents

- `Sentinel.md` — system prompt for the `Sentinel` agent.

## Conventions

- One agent prompt per file.
- Prefer descriptive filenames matching the agent name.

## Usage

Copy or reference these prompts from your OpenCode / Codex CLI configuration as needed.
